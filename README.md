 __🏥 Medical Record System (EMR)__

A simple educational Electronic Medical Record (EMR) web application.

I experienced both modern EMR systems and handwritten charts while working in a hospital.
Although existing EMRs are powerful, many felt overly complex, so I built a clean and minimal EMR system myself for learning purposes.

This project provides a Node.js Express API with a static frontend, and can be run locally with minimal database setup.

 __✨ Features__

Express-based REST API

Sequelize ORM

MySQL (dev) / SQLite (test) support

Static frontend (public/)

Basic EMR models: Patient, Encounter, Prescription

 __🛠 Tech Stack__

JavaScript (Node.js)

Express

Sequelize

MySQL

HTML / CSS / Vanilla JS

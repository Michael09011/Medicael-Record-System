# 🏥 Medical Record System (EMR)

A simple educational **Electronic Medical Record (EMR)** web application.

Inspired by my firsthand experience with both modern EMR systems and traditional handwritten charts while working in a hospital. While existing EMRs are powerful, many felt overly complex, so I built this clean and minimal EMR system for learning purposes.

This project provides a Node.js Express API with a static frontend and can be run locally with minimal database setup.
